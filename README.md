# PoseNet and TensorFlow.js

This is an example of the power of using pre-trained models in the browser. PoseNet can detect human figures in images and videos using either a single-pose or multi-pose algorithm. For more details about this Machine Learning model, [refer to this blog post](https://medium.com/tensorflow/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-7dd0bc881cd5) for a high-level description of PoseNet running on Tensorflow.js.
